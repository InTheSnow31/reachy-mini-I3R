# Expressive Movements Creation

_Anaelle Jaffré_

A methodology has been put in place to bring expressive movements to the robot Reachy Mini. This document is an explanation of the different steps of this methodology.

The whole scripts are available on the following Github repo : [InTheSnow31/reachy-mini-I3R](https://github.com/InTheSnow31/reachy-mini-I3R). The experiments made throughout this report are available in the "expressive-pose" folder of the branch I created, named "anaelle".
