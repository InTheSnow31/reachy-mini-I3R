This bibliography report influenced our methodology:
- The 2 first approaches use the **PAD** (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) model, from Russel, describled in the section about emotion modelisation and evaluation.

- The 1rst approach also uses the **Laban** space, described in the section which follows in the report.
  
- The 1rst approach is based on the **adapatation** of a functional movement, while the second one on its total **generation**. These two directions are explored in the movement modelisation section.

- The 3rd approach is based on **neural network training**, as in a lot of articles browsed.
